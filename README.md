# Network-Sniffer
Used Socket Programming to create a network sniffer from scrach to analyze the  raw packets of the system, the program sniffes the packets and at the same time create the capture file of the analyzed packets. Supports Multiple Protocols including TCP/IP,OSPF,BGP,ARP etc.

Since the program interacts diretly with the Kernel for capturing the RAW packets,the program must run with root access.
The program is in its Beta phase and some features might not work properly :)
